# TF2
🧩 Plugin for WindowsGSM to run a dedicated server for Team Fortress 2 VR Mod

## PLEASE ⭐STAR⭐ THE REPO IF YOU LIKE IT! THANKS!

### IMPORTANT POINTS, READ FIRST:
- You need to do **Portforwarding**, if you want people outside of your house to be able to connect (look down for it)
- If you want your Server to be Listed: (default is LAN/IP-Connect ONLY!)
  - Link the Server to your Account: Edit Config => **Server GSLT** (https://steamcommunity.com/dev/managegameservers App ID 1055600  (try the one of TF2 base if that does not work: 440))
  - **install the SteamClient( START IT ONCE**, no login, no autostart, just install and start it once)
  - go to the Server.cfg (WindowsGSM Click on **Browse => Server Files**, then go **\tf2\cfg** and open **server.cfg** with Editor)
    - Excange "sv_lan" from 1 to 0
- Not sure if that counts for the VR MOD: The Server can not be **connected from the same Machine**. You will need to create the server ingame (Multiplayer => create) if one Machine has to act as Server AND Client.

### Port Forwarding (YOU NEED THIS, TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE INTERNET(only for servers/pcs at home, Hosted Servers work different there, make sure you have a full IPv4 and if your provider needs explicit portforwarding):
- If You don't know How: Google: YourRouterBrand + Portforwarding
- 27015 UDP - **Default Game Port**(look in the 7th column in WindowsGSM), 
  - this one is needed to be forwarded in your Router!
- 27015 TCP - **QueryPort** default, in theory the QueryPort should not be needed as PortForward

### Connecting to a LAN Server:
- Go to Opptions
- Enable Developer Mode
- Go To Keyboard Bindings and set the Key for the Console
- go Back
- Press that key and enter
  - connect IP_OF_THE_SERVER:GamePort (if port is 27015 you can leave it out)
  - if your in the same network use the local IP of that server, else use you onlineIP

### Not having an full IPv4 adress ( named CCNAT or DSL Light )
No game or gameserver supports ipv6 only connections. 
- You need to either buy one (most VPN services provide that option. A pal uses ovpn.net for his server, I know of nordvpn also providing that. Should both cost around 7€ cheaper half of it, if your already having an VPN)
- Or you pay a bit more for your internet and take a contract with full ipv4. (depending on your country)
- There are also tunneling methods, which require acces to a server with a full ipv4. Some small VPS can be obtained, not powerfull enough for the servers themself, but only for forwarding. I think there are some for under 5€), the connection is then done via wireguard. but its a bit configuration heavy to setup) 

Or you connect your friends via VPN to your net and play via local lan then.
Many windowsgsm plugin creators recommend zerotier (should be a free VPN designated for gaming) , see chapter below (or tailscale, but no howto there)

## How can you play with your friends without port forwarding?
- Use [zerotier](https://www.zerotier.com/) folow the basic guide and create network
- Download the client app and join to your network
- Create static IP address for your host machine
- Edit WGSM IP Address to your recently created static IP address
- Give your network ID to your friends
- After they've joined to your network
- They can connect using the IP you've created eg: 10.123.17.1:7777
- Enjoy
